## The Vision

My goal here is to create a task tracking app that provides a game-like experience to completing tasks.
EXP in each goal that, when completed, is added to your total pool of EXP, with which you 
can research rewards in your reward tree.

Goals are divided into three types: tasks, projects, and epics. You can set custom 
EXP values per task or follow our default values.

I'm essentially trying to make accomplishing our goals fun, to reduce our procrastination
and encourage us to reward ourselves for our work.

## Additions

### Lists
In the future I would like to add a more hierarchical and concrete list format so that each list
type may be forced to only hold certain list types or to at least remove a bit of ambiguity from 
current list structures.

### Timers
The timers work now, that is good, but the focus timer does not. Working on it.
