## The Vision

My goal here is to create a task tracking app that provides a game-like experience to completing tasks.
EXP in each goal that, when completed, is added to your total pool of EXP, with which you 
can research rewards in your reward tree.

Goals are divided into three types: tasks, projects, and epics. You can set custom 
EXP values per task or follow our default values.

I'm essentially trying to make accomplishing our goals fun, to reduce our procrastination
and encourage us to reward ourselves for our work.
